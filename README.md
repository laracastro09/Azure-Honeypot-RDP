# Azure Honeypot RDP Lab
This project simulates a real-world cybersecurity environment by deploying a cloud-based honeypot in Microsoft Azure. The purpose of this lab was to build hands-on experience in detecting, analyzing, and visualizing attack patterns against exposed cloud resources using enterprise-grade SIEM tools.

I configured an intentionally vulnerable virtual machine (VM) exposed to the public internet, centralized security event logging with Azure Log Analytics, and integrated Microsoft Sentinel for threat detection and monitoring. Leveraging Kusto Query Language (KQL) and geolocation enrichment, I analyzed failed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) login attempts and visualized attacker origins across the globe.
